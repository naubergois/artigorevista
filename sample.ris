AB  - Whereas the verification of non-safety-related embedded software typically focuses on demonstrating that the implementation fulfills its functional requirements, this is not sufficient for safety-relevant systems. In this case, the control software must also meet application- specific safety requirements.Safety requirements typically arise from the application of hazard and/or safety analysis techniques, e.g., FMEA, FTA or SHARD. During the downstream development process it must be shown that these requirements cannot be violated. This can be achieved utilizing different techniques. One way of providing evidence that violations of the safety properties identified cannot occur is to thoroughly test each of the safety requirements.This paper introduces Evolutionary Safety Testing (EST), a fully automated procedure for the safety testing of embedded control software. EST employs extended evolutionary algorithms in an optimization process which aggressively tries to find test data sequences that cause the test object to violate a given safety requirement.A compact description formalism for input sequences for safety testing is presented, which is compatible with description techniques used during other test process stages. This compact description allows 1) an efficient application of evolutionary algorithms (and other optimization techniques) and 2) the description of long test sequences necessary for the adequate stimulation of real-world systems. The objective function is designed in such a way that optimal values represent test data sequences which violate a given safety requirement. By means of repeated input sequence generation, software execution and the subsequent evaluation of the objective function each safety requirement is extensively tested.The use of EST for the safety testing of automotive control software is demonstrated using safety requirements of an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system.The EST approach can easily be integrated into an overall software test strategy which combines different test design techniques with specific test objectives.

AB  - Software architecture design approaches typically treat architecture as an abstraction of the implemented system. However, doing so means that the concepts, languages, notations, and tools for architecture are much more closely related to those of detailed design and implementation than to those of software requirements. Thus the gap between requirements and architecture represents a paradigm shift, while that between architecture and detailed design does not. Global Analysis, which is part of the Siemens Four Views architecture design approach, is a set of activities that serves to reduce the magnitude of this gap by guiding the architecture design process, capturing design rationale, and supporting traceability between requirements and architecture. In this paper Global Analysis is re-examined in light of five years of teaching it, reflecting on it, comparing it to other approaches, and examining how it was applied in four new systems. This experience confirms the value of the Global Analysis activities and the importance of capturing its results. In some cases the benefit went beyond that envisioned, and in other cases Global Analysis was not applied as expected. Because the templates that are provided for Global Analysis results have such a strong influence on how the activities were performed, this will be the focus of future changes

AB  - In this survey we discuss different state-of-the-art approaches of combining exact algorithms and metaheuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Some of these hybrids mainly aim at providing optimal solutions in shorter time, while others primarily focus on getting better heuristic solutions. The two main categories in which we divide the approaches are collaborative versus integrative combinations.We further classify the different techniques in a hierarchical way. Altogether, the surveyed work on combinations of exact algorithms and metaheuristics documents the usefulness and strong potential of this research direction.

AB  - Research in metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization problems has lately experienced a noteworthy shift towards the hybridization of metaheuristics with other techniques for optimization. At the same time, the focus of research has changed from being rather algorithm-oriented to being more problem-oriented. Nowadays the focus is on solving the problem at hand in the best way possible, rather than promoting a certain metaheuristic. This has led to an enormously fruitful cross-fertilization of different areas of optimization. This cross-fertilization is documented by a multitude of powerful hybrid algorithms that were obtained by combining components from several different optimization techniques. Hereby, hybridization is not restricted to the combination of different metaheuristics but includes, for example, the combination of exact algorithms and metaheuristics. In this work we provide a survey of some of the most important lines of hybridization. The literature review is accompanied by the presentation of illustrative examples. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The goal of a load test is to uncover functional and per- formance problems of a system under load. Performance problems refer to the situations where a system suffers from unexpectedly high response time or low throughput. It is difficult to detect performance problems in a load test due to the absence of formally-defined performance objectives and the large amount of data that must be examined. In this paper, we present an approach which automati- cally analyzes the execution logs of a load test for perfor- mance problems. We first derive the system's performance baseline from previous runs. Then we perform an in-depth performance comparison against the derived performance baseline. Case studies show that our approach produces few false alarms (with a precision of 77\) and scales well to large industrial systems.

AB  - Search-based software testing is the application of metaheuristic search techniques to generate software tests. The test adequacy criterion is transformed into a fitness function and a set of solutions in the search space are evaluated with respect to the fitness function using a metaheuristic search technique. The application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing is promising due to the fact that exhaustive testing is infeasible considering the size and complexity of software under test. Search-based software testing has been applied across the spectrum of test case design methods; this includes white-box (structural), black-box (functional) and grey-box (combination of structural and functional) testing. In addition, metaheuristic search techniques have also been applied to test non-functional properties. The overall objective of undertaking this systematic review is to examine existing work into non-functional search-based software testing (NFSBST). We are interested in types of non-functional testing targeted using metaheuristic search techniques, different fitness functions used in different types of search-based non-functional testing and challenges in the application of these techniques. The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 35 articles obtained after a multi-stage selection process and have been published in the time span 1996-2007. The results of the review show that metaheuristic search techniques have been applied for non-functional testing of execution time, quality of service, security, usability and safety. A variety of metaheuristic search techniques are found to be applicable for non-functional testing including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant colony methods, grammatical evolution, genetic programming (and its variants including linear genetic programming) and swarm intelligence methods. The review reports on different fitness functions used to guide the search for each of the categories of execution time, safety, usability, quality of service and security; along with a discussion of possible challenges in the application of metaheuristic search techniques. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of real-time systems is an essential industrial activity whose importance is increasing. The most important analytical method to assure the quality of real-time systems is dynamic testing. Testing is the only method which examines the actual run-time behaviour of real-time software, based on an execution in the real application environment. Dynamic aspects like the duration of computations, the memory actually needed, or the synchronization of parallel processes are of major importance for the correct function of real-time systems and have to be tested. A comprehensive investigation of existing software test methods shows that they mostly concentrate on testing for functional correctness. They are not suited for an examination of temporal correctness which is essential to real-time systems. Very small systems show a wide range of different execution times. Therefore, existing test procedures must be supplemented by new methods, which concentrate on determining whether the system violates its specified timing constraints. In general, this means that outputs are produced too early or their computation takes too long. The task of the tester is to find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution times to check whether they produce a temporal error. If the search for such inputs is interpreted as a problem of optimization, genetic algorithms can be used to find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution times automatically. The fitness function is the execution time measured in processor cycles. Experiments using genetic algorithms on a number of programs with up to 1511 LOC and 843 integer input parameters have successfully identified new longer and shorter paths than had been found using random testing or systematic testing. Genetic algorithms are able therefore to check large programs and they show considerable promise in establishing the validity of the temporal behaviour of real-time software.

AB  - In this work we are studying possibilities to test software using genetic algorithm search. The idea is to produce test cases in order to find problematic situations like processing time extremes. The proposed test method comes under the heading of automated dynamic stress testing. Keywords: genetic algorithms, software engineering, dynamic stress testing 1 Introduction Real-time software is increasingly applied to products in which failure may have severe consequences, thus the requirements for correctness and reliability are getting higher, too. In very reliable sequential programs, the rate of errors should be less than 10 errors/1000 lines of code, to avoid functional failure. Achieving this level is very labourious, because the amount of program testing work grows exponentially with code size. Testing software manually is slow, expensive and demands inventiveness. Automated testing can reduce both the time and costs needed for performing tests. Exhaustive test data generation is...

AB  - This survey investigates search-based approaches to software design. The basics of the most popular meta-heuristic algorithms are presented as background to the search-based viewpoint. Software design is considered from a wide viewpoint, including topics that can also be categorized as software maintenance or re-engineering. Search-based approaches have been used in research from the high architecture design level to software clustering and finally software refactoring. Enhancing and predicting software quality with search-based methods is also taken into account as a part of the design process. The background for the underlying software engineering problems is discussed, after which search-based approaches are presented. Summarizing remarks and tables collecting the fundamental issues of approaches for each type of problem are given. The choices regarding critical decisions, such as representation and fitness function, when used in meta-heuristic search algorithms, are emphasized and discussed in detail.

AB  - With the recent rapid development of mobile devices in terms of processing power, memory and storage capabilities coupled with the advancements of wireless technology in terms of higher data transmission rates such as 3G and 4G, it has now become feasible to host Web services on mobile devices. In this paper we propose a lightweight framework for hosting Web services on mobile devices. We further evaluate and provide a comparative analysis for hosting RESTful Web services versus SOAP-based Web services on our framework. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that RESTful Web services are less resource-consuming and more efficient for the implementation and provisioning of Web services from resource-constrained mobile devices. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper studies the use of statistical induction techniques as a basis for automated performance diagnosis and performance management. The goal of the work is to develop and evaluate tools for offline and online analysis of system metrics gathered from instrumentation in Internet server platforms. We use a promising class of probabilistic models (Tree-Augmented Bayesian Networks or TANs) to identify combinations of system-level metrics and threshold values that correlate with high-level with Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for average-case response timein a three-tier Web service under a variety of conditions. Experimental results from a testbed show that TAN models involving small subsets of metrics capture patterns of performance behavior in a way that is accurate and yields insights into the causes of observed performance effects. TANs are extremely efficient to represent and evaluate, and they have interpretability properties that make them excellent candidates for automated diagnosis and control. We explore the use of TAN models for offline forensic diagnosis, and in a limited online setting for performance forecasting with stable workloads.

AB  - What makes a distributed system reliable? A study of failures in
the US public switched telephone network (PSTN) shows that human
intervention is one key to this large system's reliability. Software is
not the weak link in the PSTN system's dependability. Extensive use of
built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms in major system components
(switches) contributed to software dependability and are significant
design features in the PSTN. The network's high dependability indicates
that the trade-off between dependability gains and complexity introduced
by built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms can be positive. Likewise,
the tradeoff between complex interactions and the loose coupling of
system components has been positive, permitting quick human intervention
in most system failures and resulting in an extremely reliable system

AB  - This is the second half of a two part series devoted to the tabu search metastrategy for optimization problems. Part I introduced the fundamental ideas of tabu search as an approach for guiding other heuristics to overcome the limitations of local optimality, both in a deterministic and a probabilistic framework. Part I also reported successful applications from a wide range of settings, in which tabu search frequently made it possible to obtain higher quality solutions than previously obtained with competing strategies, generally with less computational effort. Part II, in this issue, examines refinements and more advanced aspects of tabu search. Following a brief review of notation, Part II introduces new dynamic strategies for managing tabu lists, allowing fuller exploitation of underlying evaluation functions. In turn, the elements of staged search and structured move sets are characterized, which bear on the issue of finiteness. Three ways of applying tabu search to the solution of integer programming problems are then described, providing connections also to certain nonlinear programming applications. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief survey of new applications of tabu search that have occurred since the developments reported in Part I. Together with additional comparisons with other methods on a wide body of problems, these include results of parallel processing implementations and the use of tabu search in settings ranging from telecommunications to neural networks.

AB  - Many statistical methods rely on numerical optimization to estimate a model's parameters. Unfortunately, conventional algorithms sometimes fail. Even when they do converge, there is no assurance that they have found the global, rather than a local, optimum. We test a new optimization algorithm, simulated annealing, on four econometric problems and compare it to three common conventional algorithms. Not only can simulated annealing find the global optimum, it is also less likely to fail on difficult functions because it is a very robust algorithm. The promise of simulated annealing is demonstrated on the four econometric problems.

AB  - The paper contrasts two methods to verify timing constraints of
real-time applications. The method of static analysis predicts the
worst-case and best-case execution times of a task's code by analyzing
execution paths and simulating processor characteristics without ever
executing the program or requiring the program's input. Evolutionary
testing is an iterative testing procedure, which approximates the
extreme execution times within several generations. By executing the
test object dynamically and measuring the execution times the inputs are
guided yielding gradually tighter predictions of the extreme execution
times. The authors examined both approaches on a number of real world
examples. The results show that static analysis and evolutionary testing
are complementary methods, which together provide upper and lower bounds
for both worst-case and best-case execution times

AB  - Analytically derived worst case execution time (WCET) bounds are
prone to errors, because they often rely on information provided by the
user. The paper presents a method for testing the results of static WCET
analysis. The proposed test method is a blackbox test method that uses a
genetic algorithm (GA) for test case generation. Important properties of
the method are: (a) that it requires minimal information about possible
impact data from the user and (b) that the GA guides data generation
into directions that have a good chance to yield the real WCET of the
program under test. Experimental results show that GA based testing
produces results of high quality

AB  - Many industrial products are based on the use of embedded computer systems. Usually, these systems have to fulfil real-time requirements, and correct system functionality depends on their logical correctness as well as on their temporal correctness. in order to verify the temporal behavior of real-time systems, previous scientific work has, to a large extent, concentrated on static analysis techniques. Although these techniques offer the possibility of providing safe estimates of temporal behavior for certain cases, there are a number of cases in practice for which static analysis can not be easily applied. Furthermore, no commercial tools for timing analysis of real-world programs are available. Therefore, the developed systems have to be thoroughly tested in order to detect existing deficiencies in temporal behavior, as well as to strengthen the confidence in temporal correctness. An investigation of existing test methods shows that they mostly concentrate on testing for logical correctness. They are nor specialised in the examination of temporal correctness which is also essential to real-rime systems. For this reason, existing test procedures must be supplemented by new methods which concentrate on determining whether the system violates its specified timing constraints. Normally, a violation means that outputs are produced too early, or their computation takes too long. The task of the tester therefore is to find the input situations with the longest or shortest execution limes, in order to check whether they produce a temporal error. If the starch for such inputs is interpreted as a problem of optimization, evolutionary computation can be used to automatically find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution rimes. This automatic search for accurate test data by means of evolutionary computation is called evolutionary testing. Experiments using evolutionary testing on a number of programs with up to 1511 LOC and 5000 input parameters have successfully identified new longer and shorter execution times than had been found using other testing techniques. Evolutionary testing, therefore, seems to be a promising approach for the verification of timing constraints. A combination of evolutionary testing and systematic testing offers further opportunities to improve the test quality, and could lead to an effective test strategy for real-time systems.
