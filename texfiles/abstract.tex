%% Text of abstract
Some software must respond to  thousands or millions of concurrent requests. 
These systems must be properly tested to ensure that they can function correctly under the expected load.  
Load, Performance and Stress Based Testing aims to find test scenarios which produce execution times violating the timing constraints specified. 
The purpose of this paper is the is to identify  test scenarios that exercise a system in a way that tasks are pushed as close as possible to their deadlines. The research proposes  a approach using hybrid metaheuristc in load, performance and stress test models using Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search Algorithms. A tool named IAdapter, a JMeter Plugin to perform Search Based load, Performance or Stress tests, was developed. Two experiments were conducted to validate the proposed approach. The first experiment has been applied in an emulated component and the second one has been applied in an installed Moodle application. In both experiments, the use of a hybrid metaheuristc has obtained better fitness values.
